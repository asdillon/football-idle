              <div class="help-card__title">Training Points (TP)</div>
              <p>TP is your primary training currency. It accumulates passively from your active drills every second, even while you're on another tab. Spend TP to increase individual attributes like Speed, Strength, or Throw Accuracy. The cost to upgrade each attribute rises exponentially — early levels are cheap, later levels cost thousands of TP.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div class="help-card__title">Money</div>
              <p>Money is earned from your game-day salary (paid after each match) plus any endorsement deals you've signed. It's spent in the Upgrades tab on equipment, coaches, diet plans, and unlocking new drills. Your contract salary increases each time you re-sign — a higher OVR and more contract tokens mean a bigger deal.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div class="help-card__title">Fame</div>
              <p>Fame represents your public profile and reputation. It's earned after every match — better performances earn more Fame, and wins give a bonus. Fame is required to unlock higher-tier upgrades (coaches, national endorsements, premium equipment) that aren't available to unknown rookies. The more seasons you play and the better you perform, the more Fame you accumulate.</p>

            <div>
              <div class="help-card__title">Contract Tokens</div>
              <p>You earn one Contract Token at the end of each season. When your contract expires and you need to re-sign, unspent tokens are applied to negotiate a better deal — more tokens means higher salary and more guaranteed years. Tokens reset to zero after each contract signing.</p>

              <p>You have 3 drill slots active at once (expandable to 5 via the Coach upgrade). Each slot runs a single drill continuously, earning TP every second. You can swap drills at any time — remove an active drill to free up the slot, then assign a different one.</p>

              <p>On the Attributes list, stats marked with ★ are the ones that most affect your OVR rating for your position. Focus TP on these for the biggest OVR gains. For example, a QB should prioritize Throw Accuracy and Throw Power; a CB should prioritize Coverage and Speed.</p>

              <div class="help-card__title">Performance Score</div>
              <p>Each match generates a Performance Score (0–100) based on your OVR rating plus some randomness. A higher OVR gives a higher baseline score, but variance means any single game can go badly — that's the nature of football. Your stat line (passing yards, tackles, etc.) is then derived from that score.</p>

              <div class="help-card__title">Equipment</div>
              <p>Equipment items (cleats, gloves, helmet) give flat bonuses to your match performance score or directly boost an attribute. These are the most straightforward upgrades — buy them as soon as you can afford them.</p>

              <div class="help-card__title">Coaches</div>
              <p>Coaches multiply the TP rate of specific drill types. A QB Coach, for example, boosts Throwing Mechanics drills by 25% per level. The Extra Drill Slot upgrade (also in this category) is one of the highest-impact purchases — going from 3 to 4 or 5 simultaneous drills dramatically increases your TP income.</p>

              <p>Diet upgrades (like the Nutrition Plan) apply a global multiplier to all drill TP rates. Unlike coaches which target specific drill types, diet bonuses stack on top of everything and benefit all active drills simultaneously.</p>

              <p>Endorsement deals generate passive Money income every second, even offline (at full rate unlike training). A Local Sponsor earns a small trickle; a National Deal earns significantly more but requires high Fame and several seasons of play. Endorsements are the best way to fund expensive late-game upgrades.</p>
